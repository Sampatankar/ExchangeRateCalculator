# ExchangeRateCalculator
4/20: Fetch &amp; JSON - 20 vanillaJS projects

This is the fourth project from Brad Traversy's 20 Vanilla JS projects on Udemy.com

It is an exchange rate calculator, which takes a large range of international currencies and will tell you how much you will get (without fees into account) given an amount you want.  It has been modified so that GBP (Sterling) is the starting currency.

This will use the Fetch API and move JSON objects.

Eventually I will refactor this project using React.
